What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates a .git file to track all changes.  You do it to create a repository that allows git commands rather than a plain directory

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It allows you to "walk through" what files you'd like to be a part of the repository without doing any commits.
