How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
Bcuz it showed exactly which lines had changed since last working version.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Can reuse code snippets.  Can drill down to just the early layout portion.  Can rollback to last known good.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
You can save in more meaningful places, like after a completed logical change.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Google docs isn't for coding so files are expected to be independent.  

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Git log shows you all previous commits, along with date and timestamps.  Git diff allows you to compare files to easily id changes.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
WIth version control, I'll always have a note of my last working version to revert to.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Keeping track of any future projects.
